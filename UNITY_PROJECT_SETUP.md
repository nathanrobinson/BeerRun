# Unity Project Setup - User Story 1 Implementation

## Project Configuration Summary

This document describes the Unity project setup completed for the BeerRun game as specified in User Story 1.

### Unity Version
- **Target Unity Version**: 2022.3.12f1 LTS
- **Project Type**: 2D Template
- **Platform**: iOS (configured as primary target)

### iOS Platform Settings
- **Bundle Identifier**: com.beerrun.game
- **Target iOS Version**: 12.0 minimum
- **Device Orientation**: Landscape Left/Right
- **Target Resolution**: 1920x1080 (16:9 aspect ratio for 8-bit aesthetic)
- **Graphics API**: Metal (iOS optimized)

### Project Structure
The following folder structure has been created in accordance with the copilot instructions:

```
Assets/
├── Scripts/
│   ├── Gameplay/          # Core game mechanics
│   ├── UI/               # User interface components  
│   ├── Managers/         # System managers (GameManager, AudioManager, etc.)
│   ├── Data/             # ScriptableObjects and data containers
│   ├── Utilities/        # Helper classes and extensions
│   └── Tests/            # All test files
│       ├── EditMode/     # Edit-mode tests
│       └── PlayMode/     # Play-mode tests
├── Scenes/               # Game scenes
├── Prefabs/              # Reusable game objects
├── Materials/            # Unity materials
├── Textures/             # Sprite textures and images
├── Audio/                # Sound effects and music
└── StreamingAssets/      # Platform-specific assets
```

### Assembly Definitions
Three assembly definition files have been created for proper code organization:
- `BeerRun.Scripts.asmdef` - Main game scripts
- `BeerRun.Tests.EditMode.asmdef` - Edit mode tests
- `BeerRun.Tests.PlayMode.asmdef` - Play mode tests

### Test Infrastructure
Basic test files have been created to validate the project setup:
- **ProjectStructureTests.cs** - Validates folder structure and naming conventions
- **PlatformConfigurationTests.cs** - Validates iOS platform settings and configuration

### Key Project Settings
- **Rendering**: 2D rendering pipeline
- **Quality**: Medium quality preset for iOS
- **Physics**: 2D physics enabled
- **Scripting Backend**: IL2CPP (iOS optimized)
- **Architecture**: ARM64

### Git Configuration
- Unity-specific .gitignore is already configured
- All essential project files are tracked
- Build artifacts and temporary files are properly ignored

## Acceptance Criteria Status

- [x] Unity project created with Unity 2022.3 LTS
- [x] Project configured for iOS deployment
- [x] Project structure follows defined architecture
- [x] Basic folder structure created for organization
- [x] Git repository properly configured with Unity .gitignore
- [x] Platform settings configured for iOS target
- [x] Basic project settings configured (resolution, orientation, etc.)
- [x] Test infrastructure in place

## Next Steps

The project is now ready for the next development phase. The foundation has been established for:
1. Implementing core gameplay mechanics (User Story 4 - Player Movement)
2. Setting up basic level structure (User Story 3 - Basic Level Setup)
3. Adding visual assets and sprites
4. Implementing test-driven development practices

## Build Notes

To build this project for iOS:
1. Ensure Xcode is installed and properly configured
2. Verify iOS Build Support module is installed in Unity
3. Configure code signing and provisioning profiles
4. The project is pre-configured for iOS optimization
