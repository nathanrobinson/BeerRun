# User Story 02: Basic Player Character (SpriteKit)

## Title
Implement a basic player character using Swift and SpriteKit

## Narrative
As a player,
I want to see a controllable character on the screen,
So that I can interact with the game world in BeerRun.

## Acceptance Criteria
- A player sprite is added to the main `SKScene`
- The player character uses a simple 8-bit style image or placeholder
- The player is positioned at the left side of the screen at game start
- The player node is named `player`
- The player node is added to the scene graph

## Notes
- Use `SKSpriteNode` for the player character
- All code should be written in Swift
- No Unity or C# code should be present
