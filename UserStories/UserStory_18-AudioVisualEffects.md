# User Story 18: Audio & Visual Effects (SpriteKit)

## Title
Implement audio and visual effects using Swift and SpriteKit

## Narrative
As a player,
I want to experience sound effects and visual feedback for actions,
So that the game feels more immersive in BeerRun.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Sound effects play for jumps, collisions, money collection, and powerups
- Visual effects are shown for jumps, collisions, and powerups
- Audio is implemented using SpriteKit's audio support (`SKAction.playSoundFileNamed`)
- Visual effects use `SKEmitterNode` or similar

## Notes
- All code should be written in Swift
- No Unity or C# code should be present
- Use SpriteKit for all audio and visual effects
