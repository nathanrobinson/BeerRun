# User Story 11: Game Over Conditions (SpriteKit)

## Title
Implement game over conditions using Swift and SpriteKit

## Narrative
As a player,
I want the game to end if I am injured twice or fall off the level,
So that there are clear fail states in BeerRun.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The game ends if the player is injured while already slowed
- The game ends if the player falls off the ground or screen
- A game over screen or message is displayed using SpriteKit
- The player can restart the game from the game over state

## Notes
- All code should be written in Swift
- No Unity or C# code should be present
- Use SpriteKit scene transitions for game over handling
