# User Story 15: Scoring System (SpriteKit)

## Title
Implement scoring system using Swift and SpriteKit

## Narrative
As a player,
I want to see my score increase as I collect money and complete levels,
So that I am rewarded for my performance in BeerRun.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The player's score increases when collecting money or defeating enemies
- The score is displayed on the screen using SpriteKit labels
- The score is calculated as money Ã— level number at level completion
- The score persists between levels

## Notes
- All code should be written in Swift
- No Unity or C# code should be present
- Use `SKLabelNode` for score display
