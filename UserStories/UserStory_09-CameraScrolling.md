# User Story 09: Camera Scrolling (SpriteKit)

## Title
Implement side-scrolling camera using Swift and SpriteKit

## Narrative
As a player,
I want the camera to follow my character as I move through the level,
So that I can see upcoming obstacles and enemies in BeerRun.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The camera follows the player horizontally as they move right
- The camera keeps the player centered until reaching the liquor store
- The camera is implemented using `SKCameraNode`
- The camera does not scroll past the level boundaries

## Notes
- Use `SKCameraNode` for camera control
- All code should be written in Swift
- No Unity or C# code should be present
