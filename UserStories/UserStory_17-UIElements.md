# User Story 17: UI Elements (SpriteKit)

## Title
Implement UI elements using Swift and SpriteKit

## Narrative
As a player,
I want to see my score, health, and other information on the screen,
So that I can track my progress in BeerRun.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The UI displays the player's score, health, and level
- UI elements are implemented using `SKLabelNode` and `SKSpriteNode`
- The UI updates in real time as the game progresses
- The UI is positioned for landscape orientation

## Notes
- All code should be written in Swift
- No Unity or C# code should be present
- Use SpriteKit for all UI elements
