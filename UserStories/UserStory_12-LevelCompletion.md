# User Story 12: Level Completion (SpriteKit)

## Title
Implement level completion using Swift and SpriteKit

## Narrative
As a player,
I want to complete the level by reaching the liquor store,
So that I can progress to the next stage in BeerRun.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The liquor store is represented as an `SKSpriteNode` at the end of the level
- The game detects when the player reaches the liquor store
- A level complete screen or message is displayed using SpriteKit
- The player's score is calculated and shown
- The player can proceed to the next level or restart

## Notes
- All code should be written in Swift
- No Unity or C# code should be present
- Use SpriteKit scene transitions for level completion
