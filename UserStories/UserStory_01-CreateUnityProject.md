# User Story 01: Create SpriteKit Project

## Title
Create a new BeerRun iOS project using Swift and SpriteKit

## Narrative
As a developer,
I want to create a new iOS project using Swift and SpriteKit,
So that I can build the BeerRun 8-bit side-scroller game for iOS devices.

## Acceptance Criteria
- A new Xcode project is created using the "Game" template with SpriteKit selected
- The project is named `BeerRun`
- The deployment target is set to iOS 12.0 or newer
- The main game scene is implemented using `SKScene`
- The project builds and runs on the iOS Simulator without errors

## Notes
- Use Swift as the programming language
- Do not include Unity or C# files
- Ensure the project structure follows standard Swift/SpriteKit conventions
