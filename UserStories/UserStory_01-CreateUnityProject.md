# User Story 01: Create Unity Project

## Description
As a developer, I want to create a new Unity project for the BeerRun game so that I have the foundational structure to begin implementing the 8-bit side-scroller platform game.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Unity project is created with appropriate version (2022.3 LTS or newer)
- [ ] Project is configured for iOS deployment
- [ ] iOS Build Support module is installed and configured
- [ ] Project structure follows the defined architecture from copilot instructions
- [ ] Basic folder structure is created for organization
- [ ] Git repository is properly configured with Unity .gitignore
- [ ] Platform settings are configured for iOS target
- [ ] Basic project settings are configured (resolution, orientation, etc.)

## Detailed Implementation Requirements

### Unity Version and Setup
- Use Unity 2022.3 LTS or newer for stability
- Install iOS Build Support module during Unity installation
- Configure Unity Hub with proper licensing

### Project Configuration
- Create new 2D project template
- Set up for iOS platform in Build Settings
- Configure iOS Player Settings:
  - Bundle Identifier: com.beerrun.game
  - Target iOS Version: 12.0 minimum
  - Device Orientation: Landscape Left/Right
  - Resolution: 1920x1080 (16:9 aspect ratio for 8-bit aesthetic)

### Folder Structure Creation
```
Assets/
├── Scripts/
│   ├── Gameplay/
│   ├── UI/
│   ├── Managers/
│   ├── Data/
│   ├── Utilities/
│   └── Tests/
│       ├── EditMode/
│       └── PlayMode/
├── Scenes/
├── Prefabs/
├── Materials/
├── Textures/
├── Audio/
└── StreamingAssets/
```

### Git Configuration
- Initialize git repository if not already present
- Apply Unity-specific .gitignore (already present)
- Create initial commit with project structure

## Test Cases

### Unit Tests
1. **Project Structure Validation**
   - Test that all required folders exist in Assets directory
   - Verify folder naming conventions are followed
   - Ensure no unnecessary default Unity folders remain

2. **Platform Configuration Tests**
   - Verify iOS platform is selected in Build Settings
   - Check that iOS Build Support is properly installed
   - Validate iOS Player Settings are correctly configured

3. **Project Settings Validation**
   - Test that project is configured for 2D rendering
   - Verify resolution and aspect ratio settings
   - Check orientation settings for landscape mode

### Integration Tests
1. **Build System Tests**
   - Test that project can be built for iOS (simulation build)
   - Verify no compilation errors exist
   - Check that all required iOS frameworks are included

2. **Unity Version Compatibility**
   - Test project opens correctly in specified Unity version
   - Verify no version compatibility warnings
   - Check that all required packages are compatible

### Edge Case Tests
1. **Missing Dependencies**
   - Test behavior when iOS Build Support is not installed
   - Verify graceful handling of missing Unity modules
   - Test project behavior with insufficient permissions

2. **Platform Switching**
   - Test switching between iOS and other platforms
   - Verify settings persist correctly across platform changes
   - Test behavior when switching to unsupported platforms

3. **Git Integration Edge Cases**
   - Test project behavior with corrupted .gitignore
   - Verify handling of large binary files
   - Test repository behavior with Unity version control conflicts

4. **Project Corruption Recovery**
   - Test recovery from corrupted project settings
   - Verify behavior with missing Library folder
   - Test project reimport functionality

### Performance Tests
1. **Project Load Time**
   - Measure and verify acceptable project load times
   - Test startup performance on various development machines
   - Monitor memory usage during project initialization

2. **Build Performance**
   - Establish baseline build times for iOS platform
   - Test incremental build performance
   - Monitor resource usage during build process

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Unity project successfully created and opens without errors
- [ ] All required folders are present and properly structured
- [ ] iOS platform configuration is complete and validated
- [ ] Project builds successfully for iOS (development build)
- [ ] Git repository is properly configured with appropriate .gitignore
- [ ] All unit tests pass
- [ ] Integration tests validate platform configuration
- [ ] Edge case tests demonstrate robust error handling
- [ ] Performance benchmarks are established
- [ ] Project is ready for next development phase

## Dependencies
- Unity Hub installed with valid license
- iOS Build Support module available
- Xcode installed on macOS development machine
- Git repository initialized

## Risk Mitigation
- **Risk**: iOS Build Support not available
  - **Mitigation**: Verify Unity version supports iOS before starting
- **Risk**: Xcode version incompatibility
  - **Mitigation**: Check Unity-Xcode compatibility matrix
- **Risk**: Project corruption during setup
  - **Mitigation**: Create backup checkpoints during configuration

## Notes
- This foundational user story must be completed before any other development work
- Proper project setup prevents technical debt accumulation
- iOS-specific configuration is critical for mobile optimization later
- Test framework setup in this phase enables TDD for all subsequent stories
