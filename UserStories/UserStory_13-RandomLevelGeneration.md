# User Story 13: Random Level Generation (SpriteKit)

## Title
Implement random level generation using Swift and SpriteKit

## Narrative
As a player,
I want each level to have a different layout of obstacles and enemies,
So that the game feels fresh and replayable in BeerRun.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Obstacles and enemies are placed at random intervals within constraints
- The level layout is generated in Swift code at the start of each game
- The liquor store is always placed at the end of the level
- The randomization logic ensures the level is always completable

## Notes
- All code should be written in Swift
- No Unity or C# code should be present
- Use SpriteKit nodes for all level elements
