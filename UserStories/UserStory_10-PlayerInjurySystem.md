# User Story 10: Player Injury System (SpriteKit)

## Title
Implement player injury system using Swift and SpriteKit

## Narrative
As a player,
I want the character to slow down or lose if injured by obstacles or enemies,
So that there are consequences for mistakes in BeerRun.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Colliding with obstacles or enemies slows the player
- If the player is already slowed and collides again, the game ends
- The player's injury state is tracked in Swift code
- Visual feedback is provided when the player is injured

## Notes
- Use SpriteKit physics and contact detection for collisions
- All code should be written in Swift
- No Unity or C# code should be present
