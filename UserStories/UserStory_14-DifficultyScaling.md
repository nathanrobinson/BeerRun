# User Story 14: Difficulty Scaling (SpriteKit)

## Title
Implement difficulty scaling using Swift and SpriteKit

## Narrative
As a player,
I want the game to become more challenging as I progress,
So that each level feels harder in BeerRun.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The number and frequency of obstacles and enemies increases with each level
- The player's movement speed may increase on higher levels
- Difficulty parameters are managed in Swift code
- The game remains fair and completable at all difficulties

## Notes
- All code should be written in Swift
- No Unity or C# code should be present
- Use SpriteKit for all game logic
