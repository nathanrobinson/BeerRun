# User Story 08: Money Collection (SpriteKit)

## Title
Implement money collection using Swift and SpriteKit

## Narrative
As a player,
I want to collect money by jumping on enemies or picking it up from the ground,
So that I can increase my score in BeerRun.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Money objects are added to the level as `SKSpriteNode` or similar
- The player collects money by touching or colliding with it
- Jumping on enemies spawns money pickups
- The player's score increases when money is collected
- All money collection logic is implemented in Swift

## Notes
- Use `SKPhysicsBody` for money collision detection
- All code should be written in Swift
- No Unity or C# code should be present
