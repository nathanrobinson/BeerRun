# User Story 03: Basic Level Setup (SpriteKit)

## Title
Set up a basic level using Swift and SpriteKit

## Narrative
As a player,
I want to see a simple level layout with a ground and background,
So that the player character can move and interact with the environment.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The main `SKScene` contains a ground node for the player to run on
- A background image or color is set for the scene
- The ground is implemented as an `SKSpriteNode` or similar
- The level is sized to fit a landscape iPhone screen (16:9 aspect ratio)

## Notes
- Use Swift and SpriteKit for all implementation
- No Unity or C# code should be present
- Scene setup should be in the main game scene file (e.g., `GameScene.swift`)
