# User Story 16: Marijuana Powerup (SpriteKit)

## Title
Implement marijuana powerup using Swift and SpriteKit

## Narrative
As a player,
I want to collect a rare marijuana powerup for temporary invincibility,
So that I can avoid obstacles and enemies for a short time in BeerRun.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The marijuana powerup appears rarely as an `SKSpriteNode`
- Collecting the powerup makes the player invincible for a limited time
- Visual feedback is provided when invincible
- The powerup cannot be stacked
- All powerup logic is implemented in Swift

## Notes
- All code should be written in Swift
- No Unity or C# code should be present
- Use SpriteKit for all powerup logic
