# BeerRun

An 8-bit side-scroller platform game built with Unity, targeting iOS platforms. The goal is to make it to the liquor store to buy beer while dodging obstacles, police, and church members.

## üéÆ Game Concept

Beer Run is an 8-bit side-scroller platform game written in Unity. The goal is to make it to the liquor store to buy beer. Each level involves the player running towards a liquor store while dodging obstacles and avoiding the police and church members. 

### Core Gameplay
- **Objective**: Reach the liquor store at the end of each level
- **Movement**: Player can only move forward (right) and jump
- **Obstacles**: Bushes, curbs, open manhole covers, ditches, cars
- **Enemies**: Police officers and church members
- **Scoring**: Collect money by jumping on enemies or finding it on the ground
- **Progression**: Levels become increasingly difficult with more obstacles and enemies

### Game Mechanics
- **Money Collection**: Accumulate money throughout each level
- **Score System**: Money converts to points (money √ó level number) when reaching the liquor store
- **Health System**: Tripping slows the player; tripping while slowed ends the game
- **Power-ups**: Rare marijuana power-up grants temporary invincibility
- **Camera**: Side-scrolling camera keeps player centered until reaching the liquor store

## üèóÔ∏è Building

### Development Builds

**Note**: All Unity commands require Unity to be installed and take significant time (15-60 minutes). Never cancel builds in progress.

```bash
# Development build for testing (Linux/Windows)
unity-editor -batchmode -quit -projectPath . -buildTarget StandaloneLinux64 -buildPath ./Builds/Development -logFile dev-build.log
```

### iOS Builds (Production)

**Requirements**: macOS with Xcode installed

```bash
# iOS build - takes 30-60 minutes. DO NOT CANCEL
unity-editor -batchmode -quit -projectPath . -buildTarget iOS -buildPath ./Builds/iOS -logFile ios-build.log
```

**iOS Build Configuration:**
- **Bundle Identifier**: com.beerrun.game
- **Target iOS Version**: 12.0 minimum
- **Device Orientation**: Landscape Left/Right
- **Target Resolution**: 1920x1080 (16:9 aspect ratio)
- **Graphics API**: Metal (iOS optimized)
- **Scripting Backend**: IL2CPP
- **Architecture**: ARM64

### Build Validation

After building, verify your build:

```bash
# Check build logs for errors
tail -f build.log  # or ios-build.log

# Verify build output
ls -la ./Builds/
```

## üöÄ Running

### In Unity Editor

1. Open the project in Unity Editor
2. Navigate to `Assets/Scenes/`
3. Open the main scene (e.g., `SampleScene.unity`)
4. Click the Play button in the Unity Editor

### Development Builds

```bash
# Run the development build (Linux example)
./Builds/Development/BeerRun.x86_64
```

### iOS Device Testing

1. Open the generated Xcode project in `./Builds/iOS/`
2. Connect your iOS device
3. Configure code signing and provisioning profiles
4. Build and run from Xcode

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests

**Note**: Test execution can take 10-30 minutes. DO NOT CANCEL test runs.

```bash
# Run all tests (EditMode and PlayMode)
unity-editor -batchmode -quit -projectPath . -runTests -testResults ./test-results.xml -logFile test.log

# Run EditMode tests only
unity-editor -batchmode -quit -projectPath . -runTests -testPlatform EditMode -testResults ./editmode-results.xml -logFile editmode.log

# Run PlayMode tests only
unity-editor -batchmode -quit -projectPath . -runTests -testPlatform PlayMode -testResults ./playmode-results.xml -logFile playmode.log
```

### Test Categories

The project uses different test categories:

- **Unit Tests**: `[Category("Unit")]` - Fast, isolated tests
- **Integration Tests**: `[Category("Integration")]` - System interaction tests
- **Performance Tests**: `[Category("Performance")]` - Performance benchmarks

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)

This project follows TDD principles:

1. **Red**: Write a failing test first
2. **Green**: Write minimal code to make the test pass
3. **Refactor**: Improve code while keeping tests green

Example test structure:
```csharp
[TestFixture]
[Category("Unit")]
public class PlayerMovementTests
{
    [Test]
    public void When_PlayerJumps_Should_IncreaseVerticalVelocity()
    {
        // Arrange
        var player = CreateTestPlayer();
        
        // Act
        player.Jump();
        
        // Assert
        Assert.Greater(player.Velocity.y, 0);
    }
}
```

### Viewing Test Results

```bash
# View test results
cat test-results.xml

# Check test logs
tail -f test.log
```

## üíª Development Workflow

### Daily Development Process

1. **Pull Latest Changes**
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **Verify Project State**
   ```bash
   # Check Unity version
   cat ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt
   
   # Validate project structure
   find Assets -type d -name "Scripts" -o -name "Tests"
   ```

3. **Write Tests First (TDD)**
   - Create failing tests for new features
   - Run tests to confirm they fail
   - Implement feature to make tests pass

4. **Run Tests Frequently**
   ```bash
   # Quick EditMode tests during development
   unity-editor -batchmode -quit -projectPath . -runTests -testPlatform EditMode -testResults ./quick-test.xml -logFile quick-test.log
   ```

5. **Build and Validate**
   ```bash
   # Development build to verify everything works
   unity-editor -batchmode -quit -projectPath . -buildTarget StandaloneLinux64 -buildPath ./Builds/Test -logFile test-build.log
   ```

### Code Quality Standards

- Follow C# coding conventions
- Use SOLID principles
- Maintain 80%+ test coverage on critical systems
- Add XML documentation for public APIs
- Use meaningful names and avoid abbreviations

### Performance Targets

- **Target**: 60 FPS on iPhone 8 and newer
- **Memory usage**: < 200MB on iPhone 8
- **Load times**: < 3 seconds for level transitions
- **Build size**: Target < 50MB for iOS App Store

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Unity Not Found
```bash
# Check if Unity is in PATH
which unity-editor || echo "Unity not found"

# Verify Unity installation
ls -la /Applications/Unity/Hub/Editor/2022.3.12f1/
```

**Solution**: Install Unity 2022.3.12f1 LTS with iOS Build Support from Unity Hub.

#### Build Failures
```bash
# Check build logs
tail -100 build.log

# Verify platform settings
grep -A 5 "selectedBuildTarget" ProjectSettings/EditorBuildSettings.asset
```

**Common Solutions**:
- Verify Unity version matches project requirements
- Ensure iOS Build Support module is installed
- Check Xcode version compatibility (13.0+) for iOS builds

#### Test Failures
```bash
# Check test logs for detailed error information
tail -100 test.log

# Verify test framework is installed
grep "com.unity.test-framework" Packages/manifest.json
```

#### iOS-Specific Issues
- **Touch input not working**: Check Input System configuration
- **Performance drops**: Profile and optimize heavy operations
- **Build errors**: Verify Xcode and iOS SDK versions
- **Device crashes**: Check device logs and error reports

### Performance Troubleshooting

```bash
# Monitor build performance
time unity-editor -batchmode -quit -projectPath . -buildTarget StandaloneLinux64 -buildPath ./Builds/Performance -logFile perf-build.log

# Check project size
du -sh Assets/ Packages/
```

### Getting Help

1. **Check Documentation**: Review `UNITY_PROJECT_SETUP.md` and `.copilot-instructions.md`
2. **Check Logs**: Always examine build and test logs for detailed error information
3. **Verify Environment**: Ensure Unity version and required modules are correctly installed
4. **Test Incrementally**: Make small changes and test frequently

## ü§ù Contributing

### Development Guidelines

1. **Follow TDD**: Always write tests before implementation
2. **Make Minimal Changes**: Focus on surgical, precise modifications
3. **Test Frequently**: Run tests after each significant change
4. **Document Changes**: Update documentation for public APIs
5. **Performance Awareness**: Consider iOS optimization in all changes

### Submitting Changes

1. Create a feature branch
2. Write failing tests
3. Implement features to pass tests
4. Run full test suite
5. Perform development build to verify
6. Submit pull request with test results

### Build Time Expectations

- **Project opening**: 2-5 minutes
- **Script compilation**: 1-3 minutes
- **EditMode tests**: 5-15 minutes
- **PlayMode tests**: 10-25 minutes
- **Development build**: 15-30 minutes
- **iOS build**: 30-60 minutes

**Important**: Never cancel Unity operations. They require significant time to complete properly.
